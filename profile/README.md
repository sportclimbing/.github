# IFSC Calendar and Streams

This automatically generates an up-to-date calendar you can subscribe to, to never miss an IFSC climbing event ever again.

#### üëÄ How
Copy and paste this calendar URL (**https://calendar.ifsc.stream**) into your calendar subscriptions, and it will
automatically sync with your device. This works on iPhone, Google Calendar, Proton Calendar, etc... This should keep
you updated on future seasons as well.

Take a look at the **[setup guides](https://github.com/sportclimbing/ifsc-calendar/wiki)** for help.
